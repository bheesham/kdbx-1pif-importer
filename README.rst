kdbx-1pif-importer
==================

The ``kdbx-1pif-importer`` command reads two files:

- ``.1pif`` file generated from exporting a Vault from 1Password; and
- ``.kdbx`` file generated by creating a new database in KeePass.

Pros:

- Imports most things.
- Will carry over OTP tokens.
- Supports multiple URLs.

Cons:

- Doesn't import Identities or Credit Cards because I didn't need to import
  those.

needed.
